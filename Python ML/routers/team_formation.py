routers/team_formation.py — FastAPI router for team formation

Endpoints:
  POST /team/recommend               — Score + greedy-select for custom requirements
  GET  /team/recommend/{project_id}  — Auto-fetch project from MongoDB & recommend
  GET  /team/greedy/{project_id}     — Greedy-only result with full selection log

Algorithm:
  1. Score all employees (Cosine Similarity + 7 ER diagram factors)
  2. Sort by score DESC
  3. Greedy Set-Cover selection:
       → Pick highest-ranked candidate IF they add new required skills
       → Skip if no new skills contributed
       → Fallback fill remaining slots by score if needed
  4. Calculate Optimal Allocation % (proportional to score)
  5. Return team + skill coverage report + selection log
